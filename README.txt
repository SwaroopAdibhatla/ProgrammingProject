Introduction
----------------------
The following folder contains a project with '.py' extension file .
The project is used to search keys using various algorithms and compare run time complexities.

Requirements 
---------------------
Since the package tkinter is self contained in python any version from 3.x is suitable to run the code.


Installation
--------------------
Download any version that is suitable for the system's configuration from the link https://www.python.org/downloads/

Demonstration
--------------
Open the code in python IDLE or any other python IDE and click on the run command 
After running a GUI will open with name search algorithms
Select an algorithm of your choice from the radio button
Now enter input size in the text field
Now enter input type from radio button being (Manual or Ranfom Generated)
       If random 
        i)enter key the key to search 
       ii) Check the algorithms to compare from check box

       else
      ------
      i)Enter manual input delimiting with space
      ii)Enter key to be searched
      iii) Check the algorithms to compare from check box
